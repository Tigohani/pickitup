## Overview
PickItUp is a web/mobile application of a two-sided marketplace for furniture pick-up and delivery service between person and person or shop and person.
When I need to buy furniture such as drawers and sofas, sometimes I have given up because of the cost of delivery. In order to make easy and cheap delivery of furniture I build this application.

## Problem
Sometimes people have to give up to purchase furniture such as drawers and sofas because of the cost of delivery. For example, most existing online and offline furniture stores charge about $100 for a two-searter sofa delivery. The problem identified is that not only price, but also waiting time for a delivery. Also, sometimes people have to wait for one or two weeks for a delivery.

## Solution
PickitUpâ€™s solution to this problem is to offer a two-sided market place where a person posts a task with a fixed price for the delivery and then a driver who has a van or truck can accept the task without negotiating. It will mitigate posting a task with a ridiculous price from posters.  
If no one accepts the task, the user can modify the price for the delivery.
